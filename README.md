# digital-logic-sim-chip-compiler
## Description
This tool takes chip ".txt" files for the game "digital logic sim" and turns them into chips that only contain "AND" and "NOT" gates so that you can share them with other people easier. If you don't have any save files, why not try it out with the included NAND and OR save files?
## How to Use
This repo can be used by inserting your save files into its folder and running main.py. The desired result would be a chip save file that only uses AND and NOT gates. Please note that if a chip save file uses another chip, you will need to put that chip in the directory as well.
## Dependencies
+ Python 3.x.x
+ sys module
+ json module (should be preinstalled with Python)
+ ast module (should be preinstalled with Python)
# NOTE
THIS TOOL IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AND IS NOT INDICATIVE OF THE END RESULT. THE DESIRED OUTPUT IS NOT GUARANTEED.
